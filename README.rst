Introduction
=============

This repository provides functionalities to generate synthetic wind turbine power curves for different applications such as feed-in calculations for future scenarios where the installed wind turbines are unknown.


Documentation and installation
==============================

This repository does not provide a documentation, yet. It is also not yet uploaded on PyPI, wherefore it cannot be installed using pip. If you want to use the provided functionalities you need to clone it.


Contributing
==============

We are warmly welcoming all who want to contribute to this repository. If you are interested in wind models and want to help improving the existing model do not hesitate to contact us via github or email (windpowerlib@rl-institut.de).

Clone: https://github.com/wind-python/synthetic_power_curves and install the cloned repository using pip:

.. code:: bash

  pip install -e /path/to/the/repository

As the wind-python group started with contributors from the `oemof developer group <https://github.com/orgs/oemof/teams/oemof-developer-group>`_ we use the same
`developer rules <http://oemof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developing_oemof.html>`_.
